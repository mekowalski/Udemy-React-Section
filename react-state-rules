State is quite challenging!!!
RULES OF STATE
-Only usable with Class Components
-State and Props will be confusing
-State is a JS object that contains data relevant to a Component
-Updating State on a Component causes Component to (almost) instantly re-render
-State must be initialized when a Component is created
-State can only be updated using the 'setState' function
