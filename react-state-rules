State is quite challenging!!!
RULES OF STATE
-Only usable with Class Components
  (Technically can be used with functional Components using the 'hook' system)
  (WAY MORE CHALLENGING)

-State and Props will be confusing :(

-State is a JS object that contains data relevant to a Component
  (One single State that is relevant to App, one single State relevant to SeasonContent)

-Updating State on a Component causes Component to (almost) instantly re-render

-State must be initialized when a Component is created

-State can ONLY be updated using the 'setState' function
