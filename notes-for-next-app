-Better idea/practice on basic and fundamental React
-Similar to Photos App with Unsplash API
-Essentially a Youtube browser app
  -User can enter in a search term, ie: tulips
  -Request to Youtube public, free API to search the term entered
  -Once the list is returned, display them on one side of the screen
  -User can click on any of the videos and it will be featured in the center
  -They can click the play button and see a title/description of that video


APP DESIGN
-Separate components
-Components:
  1. SearchBar: identical to Photos App
    - Show input, user can type which updates State, when the enter key is hit, that triggers a formSubmit
    event
    - Send that search term to an App/Parent component which then will actually make the API request
