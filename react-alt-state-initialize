ALTERNATIVE STATE INITIALIZATION
-Does not involve constructor function

Current/previous State Initialization
eg:
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { lat: null, errorMessage: '' }
  }

Alternative State Initialization
eg:
state = { lat: null, errorMessage: '' }

*Both are 100% equivalent

-Code written inside editor doesn't show in browser
-The written code runs through the tool, Babel
-After this goes through Babel, this will build the constructor function and initialize State
-Don't have to define constructor and utilize super(props)
