UNDERSTANDING THIS IN JAVASCRIPT
-Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
^Most common error message in every React project, will happen ALL THE TIME

undefined: value inside JavaScript
-Message states trying to reference 'undefined.state'

console.log(this.state.term)
-JavaScript thinks that inside the onFormSubmit function 'this' is not equal to instance of SearchBar class
-It thinks that 'this' is equal to the value undefined

WHAT IS THIS USED FOR
-this: References the instance of the Class Component

Instance of SearchBar
        PROPS
          |
        STATE
          |
       RENDER
          |
     onFormSubmit

        this

HOW IS THE VALUE OF THIS DETERMINED IN A FUNCTION
-Exception of 'this' working in an instance is in the console.log()
eg: Dummy Class - Set a value and later on return the value
class Car {
  setDriveSound(sound) {
    this.sound = sound
  }

  drive() {
    return this.sound
  }
}

const car = new Car()
car.setDriveSound('vrooom')
car.drive() => vroom

-Whenever finding out value for 'this'(L35) is equal to, inside of the method of a Class
-Look, not at the method itself, look at where the method is called(L41)
-L41: car.drive() | car = this
*Car class instance variable, look to the left of . when function is called


EXAMPLE IN ACTION
const truck = {
  sound: 'putputput',
  driveMyTruck: car.drive
}

truck.driveMyTruck() => 'putputput'
