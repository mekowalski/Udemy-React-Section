To use State as a Prop
-Add the State name(lat) as a property in the instance of the Component
eg: App.js/render()
if (!this.state.errorMessage && this.state.lat) {
  return <SeasonContent lat={this.state.lat} />
}

*This is where State and Props become confusing
*Can take State from one Parent Component and pass it as Prop to a Child Component
