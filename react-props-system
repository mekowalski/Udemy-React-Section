      CommentDetail      CommentDetail      CommentDetail

*App will show instances of CommentDetail
*When it shows these Components it will also pass in a little bit of configuration(L22) to each
 CommentDetail
*No limit to the amount of information that can be shared in the configuration
(PROPS = PROPerties)

TWO STAGES
1. Provide info from Parent to Child
eg:
<CommentDetail author='Malind' />
CommentDetail:      Child Component
author=:            PROPerty name
'Malind':           Value of the PROP

*This info will show inside CommentDetail


2. Child consumes that information
eg:
const CommentDetail = props => {
  console.log(props)
  return (
    //CODE
    <a href='/' className='author'>
      {props.author}
    </a>
  )
}

*L51 will display each name of provided in the Parent component App
