-The application is running inside the user's browser
-Enter search term and hit enter, make AJAX/Network request to an API

 -----      --->Send data about photos for dogs--->    ----------
| APP |                                               | UNSPLASH |
 -----             <---Here you go!<---               |    API   |
                                                       ----------
*Unsplash is a company focused on stock images or images of all types

-Send a request to get list of images of the key term(dogs)
-Unsplash API sends JSON records matching the request
-Use that JSON to render a big list of the search term results

AXIOS VS FETCH
-Not the job of React library to make request to API
-React only shows HTML content and handles user interaction
-AJAX request is a separate piece of the code(AJAX Client)
1.Axios:
2.Fetch
