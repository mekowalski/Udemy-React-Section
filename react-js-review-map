MAPPING JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS

const numbers = [0, 3, 6, 9];


-I want to create a NEW array
let newNumbers = [];

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  newNumbers.push(numbers[i] * 12)
}

numbers => [0, 3, 6, 9]
newNumbers => [0, 36, 72, 108]


MAP: will do the same thing as the FOR loop
-Iterate over an array
-Return brand new array
-Take new array and modify it to my liking

eg:
let newNumbers = [];

-MAP does the exact same as the FOR loop
numbers.map((num) => {
  return num * 12;
})
=> [0, 36, 72, 108]
*number is a JS keyword, therefore use a relating word for iterating over the array(in this case: num)
*the function on L29, 2nd () before =>
*inner function is called with each element in original array

-Simplify FOR loop and defining an array ahead of time
eg:
numbers.map(num => num * 12)
