COMPONENT LIFECYCLE
Component Lifecycle Method: function optionally defined in class-based Components
  -If deciding you implement these methods, they will be called automatically by React at certain points
   during a Component's lifecycle

1. Constructor(optional)
  -Good place to do one-time setup

2. render()(mandatory)
  -Avoid doing anything besdies returning JSX
---Content visible on screen

3. componentDidMount(optional)
  -Good for data-loading
  -If this is defined inside class, this will be automatically called ONE time
  -Only gets invoked for ONE time
  -A lot of Docs and best practice prefer data-loading in this Cycle instead of Constructor
  -This then leads to more, clear code for data-loading
---Sit and wait for updates

4. componentDidUpdate(optional)
  -Good for doing more data-loading when state/props change
  -Update comes in the form of 'this.setState' method
  -Optionally defined inside class, it will be called automatically whenever the Component updates itself
---Sit and wait until Component is not longer shown

5. componentWillUnmount(optional)
  -If this Component no longer is shown, then this will be called
  -Used for cleanup, especially for non-React

*These are not all the lifecycle methods
*The others are infrequently used
