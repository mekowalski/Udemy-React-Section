Wrap different comments in a wrapped syntax
-Wrapped Card will not always be hard-coded to show an instance of CommentDetail
-It's possible an application may need to reuse a Wrapped Card Component that will have certain attributes
 in it
-Have the ability to swap out different content

//can add a bit more JSX to show wrapping outline idea
//but the purpose of PROPs is to create resuable Components


MAKE USE OF PROPS FEATURE
-PROPs are usually used within a Component tag with single or multiple key='value' pairs

-Another way to communicate into Child Component
eg: App Component
<WrappedCard>
  <CommentDetail
    author='Malind'
    timeAgo='Today at 1:15PM'
    commentText='This was a good read'
    avatar={faker.image.avatar()}
  />
</WrappedCard>

*CommentDetail Component is now passed as PROP down into the WrappedCard Component
*It is considered a PROP because it provides some configuration to the WrappedCard Component
