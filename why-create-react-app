Used create-react-app to create a Brand New Project
-Inside this new Project will have many dependencies that help properly write the application

ES5: Common JavaScript version
-There are different versions for this ES spec after every year after 2015
-Each version has some number of new features and upgrades
-Generally to the benefit of developers

-Issue with all theses new versions
-Browsers are NOT always held 100% up to date
-Majority of browsers will support ES5 and almost true for ES2015
-Not all browsers have support for ES2016 and forward

BABEL
-It is included by default when create-react-app is used
-Takes any version os JS and gives out a newer version. It is a converter of some sort
eg:

ES2015 JS                ES5 JS
 JS File ---> BABEL ---> JS File ---> BROWSER SUPPORT & DISPLAY
