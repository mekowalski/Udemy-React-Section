-How to use them to manage feedback from user or from other systems inside program
-Update how Components render content on the screen based on new information

Functional: Good for simple content, without a lot of logic
Class: Good for just about everything else, With complex logic, respond to user input, etc

                          ------> Easier code
                          |       organization
      Benefits of         |
        CLASS             ------> Can use 'state'      Easier to handle
      COMPONENTS          |       (another React  --->   user input
                          |           system)

                                   lifecycle    --->    when the app first
                                      events                  starts

-Class Components make the code clearer to read
-State system handles user input and updates how the application looks
-Life cycle creates simple tasks when app starts up
