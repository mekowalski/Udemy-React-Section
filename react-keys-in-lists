WHAT IS KEY LIST
-Why use.define one when building a list of components
eg:

List of ToDo Items                                    Rendered List
{id: 1, task: 'Take out trash'}         ------>       <div>Take out trash</div>
{id: 2, task: 'Sweep first floor'}      ------>       <div>Sweep first floor</div>
{id: 3, task: 'Clean bathroom'}         ------>       <div>Clean bathroom</div>

*ToDo is an object with an ID and Task
*Imagine that this list is rendered in DOM and visible on the screen
*Maybe user may need to add a new ToDo Item
*Tell React to re-render application
*React will look at what's currently in the DOM to see what doesn't need to be re-rendered

-In order to allow React to render new items into the DOM, a Key prop needs to be added to each element of
 the list of items rendered
eg: New rendered list
<div key=1>Take out trash</div>
<div key=2>Sweep first floor</div>
<div key=3>Clean bathroom</div>
<div key=4>Wash bed sheets</div>

*Key props reuses the ID from the ToDo Items
*React will then compare the Current list in DOM to the new list and figure out which needs to be rendered


-Key is a performance consideration
-It will help React render or updates to list
-best interest to include Key on every element rendered on a LIST


-Why is the ID of the items used for the Key when they're rendered?
-Every one of the items will be rendered as a <div> or <li> or <span>
-Try to use a Key property(value) that corresponds to the distinct element to the array of items that are
 iterated over
-When fetching data from an external API, just about every time a list of items is retrieved, it will
 frequently have an ID property that is unique to that record thus making it suitable for a Key
