WHAT IS KEY LIST
-Why use.define one when building a list of components
eg:

List of ToDo Items                                    Rendered List
{id: 1, task: 'Take out trash'}         ------>       <div>Take out trash</div>
{id: 2, task: 'Sweep first floor'}      ------>       <div>Sweep first floor</div>
{id: 3, task: 'Clean bathroom'}         ------>       <div>Clean bathroom</div>

*ToDo is an object with an ID and Task
*Imagine that this list is rendered in DOM and visible on the screen
*Maybe user may need to add a new ToDo Item
*Tell React to re-render application
*React will look at what's currently in the DOM to see what doesn't need to be re-rendered
