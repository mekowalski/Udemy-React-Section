CONTROLLED vs UNCONTROLLED
-Developers prefer to work with Controlled elements
eg: SearchBar
class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  state = { term: '' };

  render(
  ...form/div/label code
    <input
      type='text'
      value={this.state.term}
      onChange={(e) => this.setState({term: e.target.value})}
    />
  )

FLOW
1. User types in input
2. Callback gets invoked
3. Call setState with new value
4. Component re-renders
5. Input is told what its value is(coming from State)

DIFFERENCES
UNCONTROLLED:
-Only way to figure out the value at any time was to reach into DOM & pull out value
-Technically a time where React Component knew the value input, ONLY during the type a user would type
 something into input and callback was invoked
-During all other periods of time, the source of truth was inside the HTML document NOT React

CONTROLLED:
-Input value at any instance in time would be determined in React Component State object
-Able to find value without going into DOM
-Store info inside React components NOT inside the DOM
