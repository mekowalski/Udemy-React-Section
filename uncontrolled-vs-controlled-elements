CONTROLLED vs UNCONTROLLED
-Developers prefer to work with Controlled elements
eg: SearchBar
class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  state = { term: '' };
  ...div/label code
    <input
      type='text'
      value={this.state.term}
      onChange={(e) => this.setState({term: e.target.value})}
    />

FLOW
1. User types in input
2. Callback gets invoked
3. Call setState with new value
4. Component re-renders
5. Input is told what its value is(coming from State)
